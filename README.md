# 😎 Totally Serious Portfolio

Welcome to my **very professional** and **not at all chaotic** personal portfolio. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, coffee, and a sprinkle of existential dread.

## 🧠 About This Project

This is my personal website — a space where I pretend to be a professional web developer while hiding my secret identity as a pizza-powered coding gremlin.

You’ll find:

- Pictures of me (or memes pretending to be me)
- Projects I actually finished (miracle!)
- A download button that may or may not work
- Contact info in case you want to hire me or send cat videos
- JavaScript `alert()`s because UX is overrated

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML – For structure (a.k.a. digital duct tape)
- CSS – For making it look *slightly* less terrible
- JavaScript – For making buttons yell at you
- Comic Sans – Because I live on the edge
